# Static Route Configuration â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer Lab

This lab demonstrates how to configure **static routing** between two routers to enable communication between two different networks. The setup includes PC-to-PC connectivity through routers using manually defined static routes.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Objectives:
- Configure static routes between two routers
- Set up IP addresses for PCs and routers
- Verify end-to-end connectivity using `ping`
- configure Telnet in both routers
- enable password in both routers

---

## ðŸ§± Topology:
- **2 x Routers (2901/2911)**  
- **2 x Layer 2 Switches**  
- **2 x PCs** (one in each subnet)

---

## ðŸ’» IP Addressing:
- PC0: `192.168.10.1` â†’ Gateway: `192.168.10.10`  
- PC1: `192.168.20.1` â†’ Gateway: `192.168.20.10`  
- Router0 to Router1 link: `10.1.1.1` â†” `10.1.1.2`

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- `Static-Route-Lab.pkt` â€“ Packet Tracer lab file  
- `Static-Route-Lab.png` â€“ Network topology diagram  
- `config.txt` â€“ CLI configuration commands
